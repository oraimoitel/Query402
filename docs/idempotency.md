# Idempotency & Replay Protection

Query402 paid execution supports client retries without double-charging or double-running providers.

Related: [Issue #4](https://github.com/emrekayat/Query402/issues/4)

## Header

```
Idempotency-Key: <uuid>
```

Clients generate a UUID per logical request and **reuse the same key** on safe retries (network blip, timeout). Generate a **new** key when inputs change.

## Fingerprint binding

The server hashes a canonical JSON object:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `method` | `GET` or `POST` |
| `route` | e.g. `/x402/search`, `/api/paid/run` |
| `provider` | Provider id |
| `input` | `{ q }` or `{ url }` (trimmed) |
| `payer` | Wallet public key or payment identity |
| `network` | e.g. `stellar:testnet` |
| `quotedAmountUsd` | Catalog price at execution time |

Reusing `Idempotency-Key` with a **different fingerprint** → `409 idempotency_key_conflict`.

## Covered routes

| Route | Method |
|-------|--------|
| `GET /x402/search` | Wallet / agent x402 |
| `GET /x402/news` | Wallet / agent x402 |
| `GET /x402/scrape` | Wallet / agent x402 |
| `POST /api/paid/run` | Sponsored flow |

## HTTP behavior

| Situation | Status | Body |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Cache hit (valid retry) | `200` | Original response |
| In-flight duplicate | `409` | `idempotency_in_progress` |
| Key reused with different payload | `409` | `idempotency_key_conflict` |
| Storage unavailable | `503` | `idempotency_storage_unavailable` |

## Payment proof dedup

Settled x402 payments are deduplicated by on-chain `transactionHash` from typed payment evidence. Demo payments use a stable demo proof key. A replay with the same proof returns the cached response without re-executing the provider.

## Configuration

```env
IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_SECONDS=86400
```

Records expire after TTL; expired keys allow a fresh execution.

## Client usage

**Web (wallet):** `apps/web/src/lib/idempotency.ts` — stable key per route + inputs + payer.

**Web (sponsored):** same helper on `POST /api/paid/run`.

**Agent:** `apps/agent-client/src/idempotency.ts` — same pattern on x402 GET.

## Guarantees

- Same `Idempotency-Key` + same fingerprint → at most **one** provider execution and **one** budget/spend on sponsored path.
- Concurrent identical requests → atomic lock; one winner, others `409` or cached `200`.

## Limitations

- Not exactly-once across third-party provider outages after partial execution.
- Without `Idempotency-Key`, retries are not deduplicated (except payment-proof replay on x402).
- Fingerprint includes quoted amount; catalog price changes invalidate cache alignment (by design).

## Storage

SQLite table `idempotency_keys` (shared DB with sponsorship enforcement). See `apps/api/src/lib/idempotency/service.ts`.
